yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at
optimizing fillet intersections and
plasticity in this example I'd like to
produce cleaner fillets for this
transition area
start by creating a new curve using the
line tool
and then print the curve onto the solid
to generate new edges
next select all the faces that make up
the problem area and press shift X to
remove them select the Border edges and
use the patch hole tool with its fill
preference set to smooth
with G1 continuity
right click to commit and you're good to
go oh look at the time
