yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
optimizing fillet intersections in Plasticity

cleaner fillets by creating a new curve

the keyboard shortcut shift I next add
new edges using the keyboard shortcut
Ctrl R to use the iso param tool
then select these faces and press shift
X to delete them
then select the boundary edges and use
the patch hole tool with the fill

process
