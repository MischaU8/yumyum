yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at
optimizing fillet intersections in Plasticity
in this example I can produce
cleaner fillets by adding new edges to
these faces using the keyboard shortcut
control R to use the iso param tool
then select these three faces and press
shift X to delete them
select the boundary edges and use the
patch hole tool to re-patch the surface
repeat the steps for these three faces
and you're all set
