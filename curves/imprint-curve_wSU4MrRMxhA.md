To use *imprint curve* start by using the keyboard shortcut `Shift-I`, then select the target body to [[project]] onto, followed by the curve to project and right click to commit.

The result will be the curve [[imprinted]] onto the surface of the target body which can be used for further construction. If you don't want the projection to imprint on the opposite side of the body, use the *Normal* method and click the *Bidirectional* attribute.

Use this powerful feature to make light work of complex shapes.
