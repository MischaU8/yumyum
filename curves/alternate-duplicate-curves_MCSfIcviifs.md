The *alternate duplicate* command uses the [[construction plane]] to
duplicate selected edges. You'll need to be in an [[orthographic view]] then select
the edges you'd like to duplicate and use the keyboard shortcut `Alt-D`.

New curves will be generated based on the selected edges oriented to the construction plane.

This also works when using the [[construction plane from camera]] feature, simply select some edges and press `Alt-D` to generate new curves.
