yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
a 2d Boolean process for Curves in Plasticity
if you generate 2D curves on
the same plane that overlap you can
generate a 2d Boolean Union result by
selecting the faces and pressing shift d
on the keyboard this can be a quick way
to generate more complex shapes
