When [[extruding]] a closed curve and a face the closed curve will produce a sheet while the face will generate a solid.

If you'd like to convert the sheet to a solid, simply select it and use the [[Patch holes]] command to convert the solid to a sheet. Simply remove faces using the `Shift-X` hotkey.

Be mindful of what's selected before extruding and you'll be in control of what gets generated.
