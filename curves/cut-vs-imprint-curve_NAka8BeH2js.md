To use the [[cut tool]] select the curve and press `C` then select the target solid and right click to commit.

To use [[imprint curve]] select the curve use the keyboard shortcut `Shift-I` then select the target solid and right click to commit.

At first glance both results look the same but the solid cut by the curve is split into two independent solids, while the imprinted solid remains a single solid with the curve imprinted onto the surface of the solid which can be used for further construction.

Both options are extremely useful when creating assets, so be sure to experiment with both for the future use.
