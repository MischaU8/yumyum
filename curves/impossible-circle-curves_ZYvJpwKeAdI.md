To create impossible circle curves:

Start by creating a circle curve, offset it (`O`).

To create a duplicate, select both curves, [[duplicate]] them (`shift-D F`) and move them to the side.

Use the [[Bridge Curve]] tool with the *trim* attribute disabled to
create two new curves with tangency on top and bottom, then use the [[trim tool]] to remove these inner edges.

Select each curved face and press `shift-D` to generate a single curve per face.

Scale the final two curves to your liking and you're all set.
