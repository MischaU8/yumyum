In this example I'll generate a curve using the [[alternate duplicate command]] `Alt-D`. While it may produce the shape I'm after, there's an excess of control points.

This is where *rebuild curve* can come in handy, simply select the curve press `F` on the keyboard and click *Rebuild Curve*.

This will result in a cleaner curve using less control points.
