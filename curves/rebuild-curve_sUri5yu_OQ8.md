yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
the rebuild curve command and plasticity
in this example I'll generate a curve
using the alternate duplicate command
while it may produce the shape I'm after
there's an excess of control points this
is where rebuild curve can come in handy
simply select the curve press F on the
keyboard and click rebuild curve this
will result in a cleaner curve using
less control points oh look at the time
