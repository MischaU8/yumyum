When *Object snaps* is enabled you can easily snap to faces, curves and edges.

You can disable object snapping completely using the *Enable snapping* toggle or click the three dot (â€¦) icon next to the toggle and choose which components (*Face* / *Curve* / *Edge*) you'd like to toggle on and off.

Use these options to refine snapping when creating and editing geometry in Plasticity.
