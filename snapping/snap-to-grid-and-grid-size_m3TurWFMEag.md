To enable the snap to grid option simply click the *Snap to grid* toggle in the upper right corner of the UI.

Once enabled, elements will snap to the grid when editing and creating geometry.

You can change the grid size using the plus (`+`) and minus (`-`) buttons located under the *Snap to grid* toggle where the grid size is displayed as well.

If you'd like to assign snap to grid to a hotkey, press `F` on the keyboard type `snap` then right click *toggle grid snapping* and use the [[assign shortcut]] option.
