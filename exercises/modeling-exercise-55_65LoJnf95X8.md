Let's build this simple part.

- Start by creating a [[circle curve]] and [[offset]] it (`O`) to create a smaller circle.

- Create a line curve then [[extrude]] this face to make a solid.

- Extrude (`E`) this face, followed by this face.

- [[Fillet]] these two edges then create a hole through the solid like so.

- Fillet this edge then [[mirror]] the solid (`Alt-X`) to make it symmetrical.

- Add fillets to all edges and you're good to go.
