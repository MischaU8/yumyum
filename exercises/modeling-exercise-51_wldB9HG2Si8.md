Let's build this simple part.

- Start with a default scene, center the default cube at the origin (`G F`) then create a cylinder off the top face and press `B` to create a new body.

- [[Mirror]] (`alt-X`) it to create a duplicate.

- [[Duplicate]] (`shift-D`) it to create two more then rotate (`R`) the two new cylinders 90 degrees.

- Perform a [[Boolean Union]] (`Q Q`) to create a single solid.

- Select these faces and use the [[hollow solid tool]] to create a shell solid.

- [[Add fillets]] to all edges and you're all set.
