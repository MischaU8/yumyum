Floyd here with a quick look at basic
asset creation in Plasticity to
Showcase some of the features in
plasticity let's build the simple solid
start by creating a rectangle curve add
a 180 Arc to one end trim the inner
segment and join the two curves into one
offset the curve three times move the
curves to the origin
create a sphere that snaps to the outer
curve
duplicate the two inner curves rotate
them 180 degrees then rotate them 90
degrees
and print the curves onto the sphere
then remove this extra Edge
select these faces and offset them add
fillets and you're good to go
