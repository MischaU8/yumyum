yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at basic
asset creation in Plasticity to
Showcase some of the features in
plasticity let's build this simple
object start by creating a rectangle
then use the two-point Circle tool to
create a circle that snaps to the top
edge of the rectangle press o for offset
and create a smaller inset Circle curve
select these three faces and extrude
them rotate the solid 25 degrees create
a new rectangle and use it to cut the
lower portion of the solid using the
keyboard shortcut C
hide the curves then delete the lower
solid that was created by the cut
select this face and press E for extrude
followed by f for freestyle to use an
edge to extrude parallel to that edge
use the scale tool to straighten the
front face Boolean the two solids
together
then use the line tool to create a
triangle curve and move it so it
intersects with the solid extrude the
new curve
add a fillet to the front two edges
create a single solid out of the two
solids using a union Boolean
add fillets to all the edges and you're
good to go
