yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation in Plasticity
let's build this simple Aero asset start
by creating a rectangle curve then
create a line through the center that we
can use as a reference guide use the
line tool to finish off the arrow shape
and extrude all the faces
duplicate the solid then rotate and move
it into place
make another duplicate then rotate and
move it into place and you're good to go
