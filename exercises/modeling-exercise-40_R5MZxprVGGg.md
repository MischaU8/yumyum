yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation and plasticity
let's build this simple asset create a
cylinder solid and Center it at the
origin radial array the solid in the
front view then again in the side view
duplicate this cylinder rotate it 45
degrees make another duplicate and
rotate it 90 degrees select the new
solids and duplicate and rotate them 45
degrees then again 90 degrees
create a sphere at the origin
then use all of the cylinders as Cutters
in a Boolean difference operation select
the outer face duplicate it with shift d
to make a sheet
thicken the sheet to make a solid
add fillets to all edges and you're
good to go
