yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at basic
asset creation in Plasticity let's
build this simple asset start by
creating a rectangle curve add a 180 Arc
to one side trim the inner segment then
join the curves move the curve off the
origin and mirror it to duplicate it
create a 180 Arc curve at the end of the
two curves then snap it to the top of
the curves extrude it down to make a
sheet
then use the patch tool to make sheets
from the other curves
join the three sheets then use the
thickened tool to create a solid create
a circle curve extrude it through the
solid and use it as a cutter for a
Boolean difference operation add
fillets to all the edges and you're
good to go
