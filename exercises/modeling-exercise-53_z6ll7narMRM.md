yum yum. Floyd here with a quick look at basic asset creation in Plasticity.
Let's build the simple part.
Start by creating a rectangle curve at the origin, create a circle curve and offset it.
Then use the bridge curve tool to create two new curves
that connect the circle and the rectangle curves.
Mirror the curves, then extrude these faces to create a solid.
Create a new rectangle curve, followed by a 180 arc curve and a circle curve.
Then extrude these faces to make a solid.
Create a new rectangle curve,
press C for cut and select the new solid as the target.
Delete the curve in the new solid,
select both solids and perform a Boolean union operation.
Add fillets to all edges and you're good to go.
