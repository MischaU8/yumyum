yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at basic
asset creation and plasticity let's
build this simple asset create a circle
curve then create a rectangle curve with
the height of half a meter duplicate and
rotate the curve 90 degrees then extrude
the faces up half a meter
select this face convert the selection
to edges and press shift d to create a
new curve create a 90 degree Arc off the
face
duplicate it and rotate it 180 degrees
create a new line curve then join all
three curves into a single curve
select the square curve and sweep it
along the other curve to create a sheet
use the patch holes tool to create a
solid radial array the new solid with a
count of four
then create a square curve the same
dimensions of the bounding box of the
current solids offset the new curve half
a meter
move it down and extrude it to match the
height of the other solids
if the new solid doesn't line up move it
into place
then Boolean Union all the solids
add fillets to these Corner edges then
add fillets to all edges and you're good
to go
oh look at the time
