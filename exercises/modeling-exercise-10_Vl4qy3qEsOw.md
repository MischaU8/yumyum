yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation in Plasticity to
Showcase some of the features in
Plasticity let's build the simple object
start by creating a 180 Arc with the
center Arc tool then create two new line
curves that extend the arc on each end
select all three curves and join them
into a single curve using the keyboard
shortcut J
press e and extrude the line to create a
sheet
then use the center Arc tool again to
create arcs at the ends of the sheet
patch the ends using the patch hole tool
then thicken the sheet using the thicken
tool to create a solid
select the solid and use the delete
redundant topology command
then create a new Circle curve at one
end of the solid
duplicate it and move the duplicate to
the other end
extrude both new faces to create solids
then use them as Cutters for a Boolean
difference operation
select all the edges add fillets and
you're good to go
