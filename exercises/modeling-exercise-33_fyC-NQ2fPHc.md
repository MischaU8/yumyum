Floyd here with a quick look at basic
asset creation and plasticity let's
build this simple asset start using the
line tool with SNAP to grid enabled to
create this shape bevel this point and
then disable snap to grid
create an internal Circle curve then
extrude the face to make a solid
take advantage of the ability to resize
and move the hole and adjust its
placement to your liking select this
Edge and make adjustments as well use
this ISO param tool to add new edges
then offset this face use the isopram
tool again offset this face then add a
fillet to this Edge add a circle curve
duplicate it
extrude both curves and use them as
Cutters in a Boolean difference
operation
mirror the solid to create a duplicate
and Boolean Union them together
add fillets to all edges and you're good
to go
oh look at the time
thank you
