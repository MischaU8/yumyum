yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation and plasticity to
Showcase some of the features of
plasticity let's build this simple
object start by creating a circle at the
origin use the three-point circle tool
to generate an offset intersecting
Circle then radial array the new curve
with the count of three
use the trim tool to remove the outer
segments then use the regular polygon
tool to create a six-sided curve at the
origin move it away from the original
curve then select all curves and press J
to join them
select both curves and press l tool off
them hide the curves then select the
sheet and use the patch tool to create a
solid
select these edges and add fillets
then select these edges and add fillets
create a triangle curve Press B to Bevel
the points then extrude the face into
the solid
use the new solid as a cutter in a
Boolean difference operation
add fillets to the new edges then rotate
the solid 60 degrees
create a new rectangle curve and add a
180 Arc to one side
move the curves out and extrude the
faces into the solid
then radial array with a count of three
perform another Boolean difference
operation add fillets to the new edges
and you're good to go
