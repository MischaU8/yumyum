yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation in Plasticity to
Showcase some of the features in
plasticity let's build this simple
object start by creating a rectangle
curve and add an arc to one end then
create a new rectangle curve that
intersects the First Press B to Bevel
the points then extrude the faces to
make a solid create a circle curve move
it to line up at the bottom of the solid
then extrude at the same height as the
solid Boolean Union the two solids
together
then create Circle curves extrude them
and use them as Boolean Cutters on the
solid to create holes
create a new rectangle curve and add an
arc to the end
move it and extrude it to create a solid
then Boolean Union the two solids
together
create a new rectangle curve and use it
to cut the solid then remove the new
solid
create a circle curve extrude it and use
it as a Boolean cutter on the solid to
create holes
add fillets to these edges
then select all edges and add fillets
and you're good to go
