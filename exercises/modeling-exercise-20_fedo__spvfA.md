yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at basic
asset creation and plasticity to
Showcase some of the features in
plasticity let's build the simple object
start by creating a circle curve then
offset it to create an inner curve
create a new curve and offset it then
create a line curve across the top of
the circles and mirror it to make a
duplicate on bottom use the trim tool to
remove the inner Edge
then duplicate the smaller Inner Circle
and move it like so
make another duplicate and move it here
then mirror it to duplicate it
add a new line curve and mirror it then
trim these inner edges
extrude this face to create a solid
create two new curves and bevel their
points
then mirror them to create a sideways y
shape use the new curves to cut the
solid then remove the new solids to
reveal the shape we're after
add fillets to the edges and we're good
to go
