yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation and plasticity
let's build this simple asset create a
circle curve then mirror it to duplicate
it add a connecting line curve on the
side then mirror it repeat the process
with larger circles
extrude the face and press tab to lock
distances hide the curves create a
sphere as a new body
then create five duplicates to have a
total of six
select this face and use it to cut the
Spheres in half
remove the halves that aren't
intersecting the main solid then mirror
the remaining spheres to the other side
and Boolean Union all the solids
together
create a cylinder and make a duplicate
for each sphere
then use them as Cutters for the main
solid
create a hole through the side of the
solid
then add fillets to all edges and you're
good to go
oh look at the time
