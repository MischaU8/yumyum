yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation and plasticity
let's build this simple part start by
creating a rectangle curve at the origin
then create a 180 Arc at one end
followed by a circle curve mirror the
two new curves to duplicate them then
extrude these faces use the center box
tool to add to the solid then use the
line tool to create a triangle curve
extrude the face to make a new solid
move it into place and use it as a
cutter in a Boolean subtract operation
hide all the curves then add fillets to
all edges and you're good to go oh look
at the time
