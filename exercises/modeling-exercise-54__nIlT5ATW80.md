Let's build this simple part.

- Start by creating a rectangle curve at the origin then create a [[180 Arc]] at one end
followed by a [[circle curve]].

- [[Mirror]] (`Alt-X`) the two new curves to duplicate them then [[extrude]] these faces.

- Use the [[center box tool]] to add to the solid then use the line tool to create a triangle curve.

- Extrude the face to make a new solid, move it into place and use it as a cutter in a [[Boolean subtract operation]] (`Q`).

- Hide all the curves then [[add fillets]] to all edges and you're good to go.
