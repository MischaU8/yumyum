yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation in Plasticity to
Showcase some of the features in
Plasticity let's build this simple
object start by creating a circle curve
at the origin then create a rectangle
curve that intersects the top of the
circle add an arc curve to the top of
the rectangle then trim these inner
segments
and add a small circle curve radial
array these curves with the count of
three
then offset the circle curve
select and extrude these faces
select these edges and add fillets to
smooth the transition
then create a new solid that intersects
the main solid
duplicate the new solid using radial
array with a count of three then use
them as Cutters for a Boolean difference
operation
add fillets to all edges and you're good
to go
