yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation and plasticity
let's build this simple asset create a
circle curve and offset it twice using
the o key
create a three segment line curve that
connects to the circles followed by an
internal two segment line curve
mirror the two line curves select these
faces and extrude them back then select
these faces and extrude them forward add
fillets to these edges to round off the
corners then draw a circle curve and
extrude it through the solid
mirror the cylinder to duplicate it then
use them as Cutters in a Boolean
difference operation Boolean Union the
two solids together add large fillets to
these edges then add fillets to all the
other edges and you're good to go
oh look at the time
