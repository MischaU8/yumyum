yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation and plasticity to
Showcase some of the features in
plasticity let's build this simple
object start by creating a cylinder then
offset the top face using the o key
extrude the inset face and add a taper
using the white ring handle offset the
face a couple more times to finish off
the top
create a new smaller cylinder and use
the same offset method a couple times on
the bottom face
move the new solid so that it intersects
with the cone
then radial array it with a count of six
use the new solids to perform a Boolean
difference operation on the main solid
add fillets to all edges and you're good
to go
oh look at the time
