yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation in Plasticity to
Showcase some of the features in
plasticity let's build this simple
object start by drawing two Circle
curves then create a line with tangency
along the side followed by a line down
the center
select these three faces and press shift
d to create a new curve in the shape of
the silhouette of the faces
use the trim tool to remove the center
edge
then use the revolve tool to create a
solid
create a rectangle curve that intersects
the top of the solid and mirror it to
create a duplicate curve
create a third rectangle curve through
the center of the bottom of the solid
then select all three curves
and press C to activate the cut tool and
select the solid as the target
remove the new solids and hide the
curves
create a circle curve on the top face
extrude it then use it as a cutter for a
Boolean difference operation
create a new circle on the bottom
extrude it into the solid then use it as
a cutter for another Boolean operation
select the circle curve and offset it to
create a smaller curve extrude it
through the solid then use it as a
cutter for a Boolean difference
operation
select all edges and add fillets and
you're all set
