yum yum void here the quick look at
basic asset creation in Plasticity
let's build this simple asset start by
creating a circle curve then create a
two segment line with 120 degree angle
like so offset the line curve twice
using the o key
bevel these two points to round them off
extrude these faces down
and this face up
hide the curves then select this face
and press the spacebar to create a
temporary construction plane create a
circle curve extrude it through the
solid and press T to keep the tool
rotate and move the cylinder to the
other side of the solid and perform a
Boolean difference operation
disable the construction plane radial
array this solid with a count of three
Boolean Union all the solids together
add fillets to all edges and you're all
set
