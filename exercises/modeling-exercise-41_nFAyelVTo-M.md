Floyd here with a quick look at basic
asset creation and plasticity let's
build this simple part create three
Circle curves
then use the bridge curve tool to create
a curve between the top two circles
create two side curves with tangency
offset the top two Circle curves
extrude these faces back then extrude
these faces forward
offset this face then push it in to
create a cavity
hide the curves Boolean Union all the
solids
add fillets to all edges and you're good
to go
oh look at the time
