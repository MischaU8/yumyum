yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation in Plasticity
let's build this simple asset create a
new rectangle solid then create a
smaller rectangle solid along the back
Edge add fillets to the top two edges
Boolean a hole through the new solid
then mirror it to duplicate it
create a cylinder solid then create a
new cylinder running through the
rectangle and the original cylinder
mirror it to duplicate it
create one more duplicate and rotate it
like so
use the three-point Arc tool to create a
new curve Boolean Union all the solids
together
use the curve to cut the solid then
delete the smaller solid
add fillets to these edges
then Boolean a hole through the solid
here and you're all set
