yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
using custom matte caps in Plasticity
to use a custom Mac cap start by
navigating to the Plasticity image
folder located in the app data directory
place a copy of the matcap you'd like to
use in both PNG and exr file format
rename the matcat files you'd like to
replace so you can always return to them
then name your new files the same name
as the files you're replacing restart
Plasticity and your new maccap is ready
to use
