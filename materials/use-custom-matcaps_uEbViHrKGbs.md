To use a custom Matcap (Material Capture), start by navigating to the Plasticity image folder located in the app data directory:

- on Windows `\AppData\Local\Plasticity\app-x.x\resources\app\.webpack\renderer\img\`
- on OSX `/Applications/Plasticity.app/Contents/Resources/app/.webpack/renderer/img/`

Place a copy of the Matcap you'd like to use in both PNG and EXR file format.

Rename the Matcap files you'd like to replace so you can always return to them, then name your new files the same name as the files you're replacing.

Restart Plasticity and your new Matcap is ready to use.
