yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
the object opacity material attribute
in Plasticity

Make sure the [[render mode]] is enabled then select the objects you'd like to manipulate and press `M` on the keyboard to access the [[material attributes]].

By default the *opacity* attribute will have a value of 1 which produces an opaque surface, reducing this value will produce a transparent material.

You can disable this material attribute in the viewport by simply disabling the render mode.

Use this handy material attribute to generate transparent objects.
