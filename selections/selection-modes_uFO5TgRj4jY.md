By default all selection modes are active which enables you to [[select]] objects, control points, edges and faces.

You can limit the selection to a particular selection mode by simply clicking on the modes button you'd like to work with or use the keyboard shortcuts `1` for control points, `2` for edges, `3` for faces, `4` for bodies, or `5` to return to all selection modes.

Holding the `Ctrl` key with `1`, `2`, `3` or `4` enables you to convert between selection modes. For example if I have this face selected and use `Ctrl-2` I can convert the face selection to an edge selection.

Selection plays a large role in asset creation so you'll want to be familiar with these options.
