To access all Plasticity commands available, click the three dot (â€¦) icon in the lower right corner of the UI or use the keyboard shortcut `F`.

To find a specific command, start typing the name of the command. Commands can be typed in part or full.

Right-clicking on a command in the list will give you options, such as the ability to assign a hotkey and left-clicking the command will activate it.

Some commands can only be found in the command menu so be sure to access the menu for all commands.
