To lock an item and prevent it from being selected in the viewport, make a selection, press `F` on the keyboard, type `lock` and click *Lock Selected*.

A lock icon will appear next to the name in the [[outliner]] and you'll no
longer be able to select it in the viewport.

Use the lock icon again to toggle between locked and unlocked.

Disabling selection in the viewport can be extremely useful in densely populated scenes so be sure to make note of this handy option.
