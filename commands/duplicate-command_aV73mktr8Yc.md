If you'd like to *Duplicate* a solid or curve, simply make a selection and press `Shift-D` on the keyboard.

A duplicate will be generated and selected with the [[move tool]] active, enabling you to reposition the new item.

You'll most likely use this feature often so make note of the shortcut for quick access.
