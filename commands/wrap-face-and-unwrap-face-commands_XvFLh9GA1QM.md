Start by selecting the face you'd like to unwrap, then press `F` on the keyboard, type `wrap` and click the *Unwrap Face*
command.

New curves will be generated that you can use as [[reference guides]].

Next create a curve within the bounds of the reference curves, then select the new curve along with the reference curves.

Add the original face to the selection, then press `F` on the keyboard type `wrap` and click the *Wrap Face* command.

The new curve will be [[imprinted]] onto the surface of the solid.
