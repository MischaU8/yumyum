When lofting (`L`) these two circle curves, a linear G0 continuity is created regardless of the [[continuity option]] selected.

To create a loft with a radius, try one of these options:

* First extrude (`E`) each curve to make sheets, then loft (`L`) the edges of the sheets. Select the continuity you'd like and you're all set.

* Another option is to create two line curves off the circle curves, loft (`L`) the points, then [[sweep]] the new curve to make a sheet.

Experiment with these options and use what works best for you.
