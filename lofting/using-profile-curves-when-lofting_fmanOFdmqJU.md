# Using Profile Curves when Lofting in Plasticity

To help define the shape when lofting curves you can use [[Profile Curves]].

In this example I'll loft these four curves and use the oval and rounded rectangle curves as profiles.

Take note that the start and end of the four curves intersect with the profile curves as indicated by the blue green control points.

- press `L` to [[Loft]]
- then select the first profile and shift select the second profile
- right click to commit

I'll follow it up by patching the holes using the [[patch holes]] command.
