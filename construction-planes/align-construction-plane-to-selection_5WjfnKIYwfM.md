Start by making a selection and then press `Shift-Spacebar` on the keyboard. The [[construction plane]] will be aligned to the selection enabling you to easily model with that orientation.

If you'd like to align the camera to the construction plane as well, simply make a selection and press the `Spacebar`. The construction plane will be aligned to the selection and the camera will be aligned to the construction plane.

Experiment with each of these options as both can be useful when creating assets.
