When creating new geometry such as curves the curves will be positioned on the [[construction plane]]. If you start drawing a new curve on a face the curve will be planar to that face.

You can disable [[object snaps]] if you'd like to have the new curve position on the construction plane instead of the face. Or you can leave the object snaps enabled and use one of the axis view construction planes located in the right side of the UI.

When an axis view is used by double clicking on one of the available options (*XY* / *YZ* / *XZ*). All new geometry will be created on the construction plane, even if you start drawing on a face.

Add these handy construction planes to your toolkit to speed up asset creation.
