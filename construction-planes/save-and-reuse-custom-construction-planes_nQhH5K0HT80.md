Using [[construction planes]] while creating a mesh can be incredibly useful. If you'd like to save a custom construction plane, simply left-click on the temporary construction plane label at the top of the screen and it'll be added to the construction plane list on the right side of the UI.

To recall the saved construction plane, simply click on it. Double-clicking it will align the plane to the camera. To remove a custom plane, select it and press `Delete`.
