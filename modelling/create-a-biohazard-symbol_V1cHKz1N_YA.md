yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
creating a biohazard symbol in
Plasticity start by creating a small
circle at the origin followed by two
additional Circle curves like so
radial array the two larger curves with
a count of three then use the trim tool
to remove the inner segments
create two more Circle curves to create
a ring shape then offset these three
Circle curves
select the faces that make up the main
biohazard shape and extrude them
hide the curves
then create a rectangle curve that
intersects the top of the solid and a
smaller one that intersects the middle
extrude these new faces and make sure
they both intersect the solid
then radial array them with a count of
three
use the new solids as Cutters on the
main solid
in a Boolean difference operation add
fillets to all edges and you're good to
go
