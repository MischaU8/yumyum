yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at creating
a radiation symbol in plasticity start
by creating a circle curve and offset it
with the lock distances attribute
enabled to create two new curves create
a new Circle curve in the center and
offset it to produce another curve
create a line curve that runs through
the center of the circles then radial
array it with a count of three use the
trim tool to remove these inner segments
then select the faces that make up the
symbol and extrude them to create a
solid hide the curves add fillets to all
edges and you're all set
oh look at the time
