Start by creating a sphere with the radius equal to half the slot width, choose the new body (`B`) option, then select the edges you'd like to work with.

Increase the *fillet distance* then press and hold the `Shift` key and click on the sphere to reference it.

Hide or remove the sphere and you're all set.

Another option is to create a 180 arc curve using the [[center point arc tool]] and use it to [[cut]] (`C`) the main solid.

Explore both options and use what works best for you.
