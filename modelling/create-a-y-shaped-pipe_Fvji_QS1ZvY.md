Floyd here with a quick look at creating
a y-shaped pipe in plasticity start by
creating a 180 Arc using the center
point Arc tool then use the split curve
tool to add a point to the center of the
curve move the curve off the origin and
then extrude it
use the radial array tool to create
three copies around the origin
use the Loft command to bridge the three
sides together
then select all sheets and join them
using the keyboard shortcut J select all
three edges on top and use the patch
holes tool to close it off
use the keyboard shortcut alt X to
mirror the sheet then join the two
sheets into one use the thickened sheet
tool to give the pipe some thickness and
you're all set oh look at the time
