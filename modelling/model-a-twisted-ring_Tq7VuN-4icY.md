Floyd here with a quick look at modeling
a twisted ring in plasticity start by
creating a large Circle curve then
create a smaller Circle curve in the
front view duplicate it twice to produce
a total of three Curves in a triangle
formation
move them over to the original curve
then use the sweep tool and enter 2080
for the twist attribute
hide the curves and you're all set oh
look at the time
