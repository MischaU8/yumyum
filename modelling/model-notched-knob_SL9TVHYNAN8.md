Floyd here with a quick look at modeling
a notched knob and plasticity create a
large Circle curve then create a smaller
Circle curve on the inner Edge and
mirror it to create a duplicate create a
line curve to connect the two smaller
curves and mirror it extrude all the
faces and flare the bottom out
then extrude these faces up
create a rectangle curve extrude it move
it into place and use it as a cutter and
a Boolean difference operation
select these cavity faces and press alt
D for alternate duplicate to create a
solid move it to create an offset then
Boolean Union all the solids add fillets
to all edges but in stages as seen here
and you're all set oh look at the time
