Start with a cube, select the three edges that make up the corner that you'd like to edit.

[[Chamfer]] the edges. [[Offset]] the corner face to remove it.

Add [[fillets]] to the corner edges.

Use the [[isoparam tool]] (`Ctrl-R`) to add edges to the three
ends.

Remove the corner faces (`Shift-X`). [[Patch]] the open boundary edges and you're good to go.
