yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at creating
curved fan blades and plasticity start
by creating a rectangle curve scale one
end and bevel the points to round off
the corners create a line curve
duplicate it rotate it and move it to
the other side of the main curve
Loft the two line curves to create a
sheet then use the first curve to cut
the sheet remove the outer sheet
thicken the remaining sheet to create a
solid radial array with a count of five
add a cylinder solid in the middle and
you're all set
oh look at the time
