yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at creating
a ring terminal in plasticity start by
creating a circle curve then press o to
offset it and create a smaller inset
curve create a rectangle curve at the
base of the circle then use the trim
tool to remove the overlapping segments
join the curves then bevel these points
to round off the transition extrude the
face then create two new Circle curves
and extrude a pipe solid
move the pipe into place
then use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl R to
cut the end face of the pipe offset the
lower face
then Loft these two faces to create a
bridge between the two solids
hide the curves then Union Boolean the
three solids into one
add a fillet to these edges and you're
all set
oh look at the time
