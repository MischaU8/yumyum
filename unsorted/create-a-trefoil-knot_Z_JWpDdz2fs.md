yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
creating a Trey foil knot and plasticity
start by creating a small circle curve
offset from the origin duplicate the
curve and rotate it 120 degrees with the
rotation pivot at the origin use the
center point Arc tool to create an arc
that connects to the center of the two
circles hide the circle curves then
subdivide the arc curve move the center
point out like so
then move these two points up and these
two points down radial array the curve
with the count of three
join the curves into a single curve
double-click the three points where the
curve is connected
then select these points and scale them
out to smooth the curve then scale these
points to further smooth the Curve
use the pipe tool to create a solid from
the curve and you're all set
oh look at the time
