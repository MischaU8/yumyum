yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at creating
an icosahedron from a cube in plasticity
start with the new scene and move the
default Cube to the origin by pressing
the G key on the keyboard to activate
the move tool press f for freestyle and
right click twice create a two segment
line in the shape of a V with a 21
degree angle this snaps to the top and
middle of one side of the cube mirror
the new curve vertically then mirror
both curves horizontally to create four
curves select the cube followed by the
curves and press C to cut the cube with
the curves
then delete the four corner solids
rotate the four curves 90 degrees with
the pivot at the origin then rotate it
90 degrees around the z-axis
cut the cube with the curves and delete
the corner solids
rotate the four curves 90 degrees with
the pivot at the origin
then rotate it 90 degrees around the
y-axis
cut the cube again with the curves and
delete the corner solids
use the line tool to create a triangle
with each point snapping to the points
on the main solid like so
mirror the triangle curve horizontally
then mirror both tries vertically
mirror all four tries to create a total
of eight triangles
then use the imprint curve feature
with the method set to normal
to slice the tries onto the main solid
select these three faces and use the
keyboard shortcut shift X to remove them
then select the solid and use the patch
holes command to create a face repeat
this process for each of the remaining
seven three-phase pyramid topology
until you have a finished icosahedron
oh look at the time
