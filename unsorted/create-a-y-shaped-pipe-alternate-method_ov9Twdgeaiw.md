start by creating a 180 Arc using the
center point Arc tool then use the split
curve tool to add a point in the center
of the curve and add a point in the
middle of each side of the curve move
the curve off the origin and extrude it
use the radial array tool to create
three copies around the origin use the
Loft command to bridge the three sides
together
