yum yum Floyd here with a quick tip for
tapering rotated solids and plasticity
if you have a rotated solid and you use
the angle adjacent attribute of the
offset tool to try and taper the solid
you may notice that the opposite end of
the solid changes size as well if this
isn't the result you're after
use the draft face tool to achieve a
taper at one end without affecting the
other end oh look at the time
