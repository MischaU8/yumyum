yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at a key
difference between thicken and Hollow
solid in plasticity for this top sheet
I'll use the thicken tool to add
thickness and create a solid for this
bottom sheet I'll patch the holes and
create a solid
then use the hollow solid tool to
produce similar results as the top Solid
if we look at the two Circle ends we'll
see a noticeable difference on the ring
faces which result is correct depends on
what your needs are but this is worth
taking note for future asset creation
add both tools to your toolkit to expand
your options in plasticity
