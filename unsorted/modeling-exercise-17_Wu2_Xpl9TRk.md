yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation and plasticity to
Showcase some of the features in
plasticity let's build this simple
object start by creating a circle curve
at the origin then create a smaller
Circle curve and a radial array with the
count of six
select the smaller curves and offset
them using the o key
use the three-point circle tool to
create a new Circle curve that touches
two of the existing curves
then radial array it with a count of six
select the faces and extrude them to
make a solid hide the curves then add
fillets to the edges and you're good to
go oh look at the time
