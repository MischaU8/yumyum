Floyd here with a quick look at modeling
a chain in plasticity start by creating
a square curve create a 180 arc on one
side of the square then mirror it to
make a duplicate select the three faces
and press shift d to create a new curve
based on the silhouette of the selection
then press P to create a pipe solid
duplicate the solid then rotate it 90
degrees create a new curve that you can
use the chain links to follow
then select one of the solids and make
duplicates using the curve array tool
take note of the number of duplicates
select and delete every other solid
curve array the other solid with the
same duplicate count then delete every
other duplicate and your chain is ready
to go
oh
look at the time
