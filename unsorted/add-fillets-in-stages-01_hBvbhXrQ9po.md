yum yum Floyd here with a quick tip for
adding fillets and plasticity in most
cases I can usually get away with adding
fillets to all edges in one step as seen
in most of my previous videos but for
instances we're attempting to add
Philips to all edges fails or produces
undesirable results as with this example
my recommendation is to add the Phillips
and stages by breaking the process up
you can usually achieve the results
you're after and you can also gain more
control on the overall results
oh look at the time
