yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
optimizing fillet intersections and
plasticity in this example I can produce
cleaner fillets by adding new edges
using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl R to
use the iso param tool then select these
faces and press shift X to delete them
all that's left is to select the
boundary edges and use the patch hole
tool to finish the process oh look at
