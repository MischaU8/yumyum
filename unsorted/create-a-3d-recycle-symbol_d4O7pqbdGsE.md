yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at creating
a 3D recycle symbol and plasticity start
by creating a rectangle curve duplicate
it rotate it 60 degrees then move it
behind an offset from the original use
the regular polygon tool to create a
triangle then move it and scale it into
place trim the inner edges then join all
curves
create sheets from the curves
then duplicate the end edge of the arrow
sheet rotate it 30 degrees and move it
between the two sheets
select the two end edges in the new
curve and press L to Loft
join the three sheets into one with the
J key
use the thicken tool to create a solid
radial array the solid with the count of
three then move the solids into place so
that the inner edges create a triangle
and you're good to go
oh look at the time
