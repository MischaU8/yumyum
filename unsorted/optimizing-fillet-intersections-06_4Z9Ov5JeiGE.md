yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
optimizing fillet intersections and
plasticity in this example after I add
fillets to these edges I can produce
cleaner fillets by adding new edges
using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl R to
use the isopram tool then select these
Corner faces and press shift X to delete
them
then select the boundary edges and use
the patch hole tool with the fill
preference set to smooth to finish the
process
oh look at the time
