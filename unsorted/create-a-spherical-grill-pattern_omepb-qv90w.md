yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
creating a spherical Grille pattern in
plasticity start by creating a sphere
solid then radial array it with a count
of three
create another sphere in the center as a
new body create a line curve and cut the
new sphere through the middle using the
cut tool move the hemisphere up then use
the other spheres as Cutters for a
Boolean difference operation select the
main face and use shift d to create a
sheet
duplicate the sheet and move it
diagonally
then make duplicates using the rectangle
array tool
select the top edges and press shift e
to generate new curves
create a new rectangle curve on the same
plane as the circle curves extrude the
face then delete the top and sides of
the solid to create a sheet
hide the Curves in your spherical Grille
pattern is ready to go
oh look at the time
