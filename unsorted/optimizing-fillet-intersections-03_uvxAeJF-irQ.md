yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
optimizing fillet intersections and
plasticity in this example if I add
fillets to these edges
the result of the transition area is
undesirable
to produce cleaner fillets
start by adding new edges using the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl R to use the iso
param tool you can use the Tab Key to
toggle between vertical and horizontal
cuts
another option for adding new edges is
to create new curves and use the imprint
curve tool
then simply remove the faces you'd like
to rebuild and then use the patch hole
tool
use this process to clean up other areas
until you achieve the result you're
after
and you're good to go
oh look at the time
