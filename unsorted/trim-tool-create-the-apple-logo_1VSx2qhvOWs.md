yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
using the trim tool to create the Apple
logo and plasticity for this example I
created 11 intersecting Circle curves
using the center circle tool all that's
left to do is activate the trim tool and
click on the portions of the curve I'd
like to remove or trim away those
familiar with Adobe Illustrator shape
Builder tool should fill right at home
as it's a very similar approach to
building custom shapes from multiple
curves once all the unneeded curves have
been trimmed simply select the two
portions of the logo and extrude them
next select all the construction items
and delete them to clean things up and
you're all set oh look at the time
