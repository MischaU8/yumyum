yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation and plasticity to
Showcase some of the features of
plasticity let's build this simple shape
start by creating a large circle at the
origin and a smaller Circle off to the
side use the line tool to create a line
across the top
then mirror it to the bottom
add the small circle to the selection
