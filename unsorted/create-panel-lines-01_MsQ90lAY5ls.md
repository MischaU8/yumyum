Floyd here with a quick look at creating
panel lines and plasticity to create
panel lines on a solid simply create
curves that intersect the solid where
you'd like the panel lines to be
generated then select the curves and
press C on the keyboard to activate the
cut tool and select the solid you'd like
to cut
then select the edges on each solid and
add fillets
repeat this process for additional panel
lines and you're all set oh look at the
