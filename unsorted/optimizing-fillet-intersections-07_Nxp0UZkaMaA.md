yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
optimizing fillet intersections and
plasticity in this example I can produce
cleaner fillets by creating a new curve
than using the imprint curve tool using
the keyboard shortcut shift I next add
new edges using the keyboard shortcut
Ctrl R to use the iso param tool
then select these faces and press shift
X to delete them
then select the boundary edges and use
the patch hole tool with the fill
preference at the smooth to finish the
process
oh look at the time
thank you
