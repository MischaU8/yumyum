Floyd here with a quick look at modeling
a simple pillow and plasticity start by
creating a wavy 180 degree Arc curve
then select every other point on the
curve and move it forward
next create a two segment line curve and
bevel the corner point to round it off
mirror the new curve then join the two
curves together
move the join curve back
then create a line that connects the two
curves subdivide the line using the
keyboard shortcut alt 1 then move the
new point to create an arc mirror the
new curve and then snap the end point to
the start point of the wavy curve select
the first two curves and press L to
activate the Loft tool
shift select the other two curves to use
them as guides then right click to
commit
mirror the sheet and then join the two
sheets into one
mirror the sheet again and use the join
command again
select the edge loop around the pillow
and duplicate it to create a new curve
press P to create a pipe
then create a sphere at the origin and
flatten it with the scale tool
make a duplicate for the other side and
you're good to go
