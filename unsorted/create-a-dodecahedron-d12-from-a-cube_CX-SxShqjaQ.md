yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
creating a dodecahedron from a cube in
plasticity start with the new scene and
move the default Cube to the origin by
pressing the G key on the keyboard to
activate the move tool press f for
freestyle and right click twice create a
two segment line in the shape of a V
with a 30 degree angle that snaps to the
top and middle of one side of the cube
mirror the new curve vertically
then mirror both curves horizontally to
create four curves select the cube
followed by the curves and press C to
cut the cube with the curves then delete
the four corner solids
rotate the four curves 90 degrees with
the pivot at the origin
then rotate it 90 degrees around the
z-axis
cut the cube with the curves and delete
the corner solids
rotate the four curves again 90 degrees
with the pivot at the origin
then rotate it 90 degrees around the
y-axis
cut the cube with the curves and delete
the corner solids
then simply delete the curves and your
dodecahedron is ready to go
oh look at the time
thank you
