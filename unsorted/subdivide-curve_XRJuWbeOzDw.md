Floyd here with a quick look at the
subdivide curve command and plasticity
if you'd like to add more control points
to a curve while maintaining its shape
use the subdivide curve command by
clicking on the subdivide curve icon in
the lower right corner of the UI or by
pressing the keyboard shortcut alt one
this can be a quick way to make denser
curves oh look at the time
