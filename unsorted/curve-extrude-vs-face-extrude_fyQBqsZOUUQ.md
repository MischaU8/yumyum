yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
the difference between extruding a curve
and a face in plasticity when extruding
a closed curve and a face the closed
Curve will produce a sheet while the
face will generate a solid if you'd like
to convert the sheet to a solid simply
select it and use the patch holes
command
to convert the solid to a sheet simply
remove faces using the shift X hotkey
be mindful of what's selected before
extruding and you'll be in control of
what gets generated oh look at the time
