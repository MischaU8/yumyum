yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at creating
a tetrahedron and plasticity start by
creating a triangle with the regular
polygon tool duplicate it using shift d
then rotate the duplicate 180 degrees
setting the pivot to the edge of the
triangle duplicate and rotate the
duplicate again then use the mirror tool
to create a fourth triangle rotate the
three outer triangles 109.5 degrees to
make a pyramid
if all the points aren't green hold Ctrl
and snap them in place select all the
curves and use the patch holes command
to create four sheets
join the sheets to make a solid and
you're all set
oh look at the time
