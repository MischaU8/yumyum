Floyd here with a quick look at creating
a t-pipe junction in plasticity start
with a cylinder duplicate it rotate it
90 degrees and then move it above the
original cylinder select the bottom face
of the top cylinder then click the match
face button followed by the bottom
cylinder face select both solids and use
Union Boolean to create a single solid
use the line tool to create a line that
matches the intersection of the two
pipes then mirror it
merge the two new curves Press B to
Bevel the middle control point
press the o key for offset and the Tab
Key to offset on both sides of the Curve
commit and delete the middle curve
select the solid followed by the two
curves and press C for cut
delete the middle solid
then select the interfaces and press L
to Loft between the two solids select
all three solids and Union Boolean them
together into a single solid select all
three end cap faces and use the hollow a
solid tool to finish off the pipe with
some thickness change the render mode to
have a look at the finished t-pipe and
you're good to go oh look at the time
