yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
generating knurling and plasticity for
this example we'll add knurling to this
cylinder start by creating a line that
snaps to the bottom and top Edge like so
press shift I to activate the imprint
curve tool select the cylinder and right
click to commit select the imprinted
Edge and duplicate it
then press the P key to activate the
pipe tool
change the vertex count to 3 then right
click to commit offset the two end faces
of the pipe to extend it beyond the
height of the cylinder
mirror the pipe then snap the duplicate
to the center of the original to create
an X
select both pipes and use the radial
array tool to create as many duplicates
as you'd like
select the cylinder
followed by all the pipe solids then
press Q for Boolean and perform a
Boolean difference
your knurling is all set
oh look at the time
