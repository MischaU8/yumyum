Floyd here with a quick look at modeling
a three button remote and plasticity
start by creating a simple curve and
mirror it horizontally and then
vertically to create the silhouette of a
remote press J to join the curves create
three Circle Curves in the middle
then offset them by pressing o on the
keyboard use the trim tool to remove the
overlapping segments then create a
fourth circle on top
select all of the circle curves and move
them off the origin
then merge all the Border curves into a
single curve using the keyboard shortcut
J
extrude the main face
create a new curve in the side view and
mirror it to duplicate it
select the solid followed by the curves
and press C for cut
then remove the new solids hide the
curves
and create fillets on top and bottom of
the solid to round It Off
select the solid and the circle border
curve press shift I for imprint curve
and enable height occlusion
offset the new face
then add a fillet to these sharp edges
select the cavity faces and press alt D
for alternate duplicate
then add fillets to the edges of the
duplicate
extrude the three Circle faces into the
main solid press Q for Boolean followed
by T for keep tools
hide the curves
then offset the top face of the
cylinders to shorten their height
add fillets to the buttons into the
button cavities
then use the final Circle curve to punch
a hole in the main solid
add Phillips to the new hole and you're
all set oh look at the time
okay
