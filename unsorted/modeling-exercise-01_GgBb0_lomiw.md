yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
basic asset creation and plasticity to
Showcase some of the features in
plasticity let's build this simple
object start by creating a cylinder at
the origin using the cylinder tool
select the top face and press o on the
keyboard to offset the face then push it
all the way through to create a hole
activate the corner rectangle tool hover
over the top edge of the cylinder and
press the shift key to create a guide
then draw out a rectangle the height of
the cylinder select and move these two
points into the cylinder
then activate the center point Arc tool
and create a 180 Arc that's snapped to
the end of the rectangle use the trim
tool to remove the inner segment
then select and join the two curves into
a single curve extrude the face and
press the Tab Key to enable lock
distances
use radial array to duplicate the new
solid and use a value of 3 for the
number attribute
select all solids and press Q twice to
perform a union Boolean
then select all the edges and add a
fillet and you're all set
oh look at the time
