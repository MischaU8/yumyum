yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at
connecting or lofting two circles with a
radius and plasticity when lofting these
two Circle curves a linear G zero
continuity is created regardless of the
continuity option selected to create a
loft with a radius try one of these
options first extrude each curve to make
sheets then Loft the edges of the sheets
select the continuity you'd like and
you're all set another option is to
create two line curves off the circle
curves Loft the points then sweep the
new curve to make a sheet experiment
with these options and use what works
best for you
