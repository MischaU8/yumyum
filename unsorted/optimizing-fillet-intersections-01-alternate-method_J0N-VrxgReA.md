yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at
optimizing fillet intersections and
plasticity in this example I'd like to
produce cleaner fillets for this
transition area start by adding new
edges using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl R
to use the isopram tool
use the Tab Key to toggle between
vertical and horizontal Cuts with the
new edges created select the faces you'd
like to clean
and press shift X to delete them select
the boundary edges and use the patch
hole tool with the fill preference set
to smooth and you're all set oh look at
the time
