yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
modeling a half Twisted ring in
plasticity start by creating a 180 art
curve mirror it then create a square
curve sweep the square curve with the
top Arc and use a Twist of 360. then
sweep the rectangle curve with the
bottom Arc with no twist create a line
curve and mirror it twice to create four
curves
use them to cut the two sheets then
remove the four inch sheets
use the bridge curve tool to create four
new curves that are tangent to the end
edges of the sheets
Loft them to create four new sheets
then join the sheets and Patch the ends
use the faces at the end of the top and
bottom solids to cut the middle solid
and remove the smaller overhang solids
Boolean Union the three solids
then repeat the steps for the other side
to complete the ring and you're all set
oh look at the time
