of the line push the top face down
holding the control key to snap the face
to the line curve we created draw two
more point two meter line curves that we
can use as guides select the top face
activate the iso param tool and add two
new segments that snap to the ends of
our new reference curves offset these
faces
add chamfers to these edges then select
this face and press the space bar to
create a temporary construction plane
create a circle curve and extrude it
through the solid to create holes
adjust the height of the back wall to
your liking add Phillips to all edges
