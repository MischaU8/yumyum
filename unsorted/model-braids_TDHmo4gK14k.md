yum yum Floyd here with a quick look at
modeling braids and plasticity start by
creating a curve with nine control
points in the shape of an s
select the second and sixth point on the
curve and move it down
then the fourth and eighth point
and move it up to create an Infinity
shape
use the rectangular array to make
duplicates of the Curve
and make sure the endpoints share the
same location by snapping them to each
other
join all the curves into a single curve
then press p on the keyboard to activate
the pipe tool increase the section size
to your liking and commit make two
duplicates and move them into place and
you're all set
add this simple process to your toolkit
to generate braids oh look at the time
