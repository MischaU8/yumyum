yum yum
Floyd here with a quick look at basic
asset creation and plasticity to
Showcase some of the features in
plasticity let's build this simple
object start by creating a circle curve
then use radial array to create two new
Circle curves equally spaced use the
line tool to connect the three circles
with three new curves use the keyboard
shortcut o to offset the three Circle
curves
then offset the inner shape
with the inner shape still selected
Press B to Bevel the points
extrude these faces down
then extrude the ring faces up
hide the curves then perform a union
Boolean to the three solids to create a
single solid
add a fill it to all edges and you're
good to go
oh look at the time
