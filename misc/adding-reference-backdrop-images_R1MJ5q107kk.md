Although you can import images using the *import* option in the main menu, I prefer to simply drag and drop the images into the viewport.

Once imported you can [[transform]] the images using the standard move, rotate and scale tools.

I also prefer to lower the [[opacity]] of my reference images to make it easier to work with them while I model. To do this simply select them and press the `M` key, then adjust the *opacity* attribute to your liking.

To keep things tidy, select the images and press `Ctrl-G` to group the multiple images, then rename the group to something that makes sense to you. By having all the reference images in a single group you can quickly [[lock]] or [[hide]] them by locking and hiding the group.

Use this simple setup to work with reference images during the creation of your assets.
