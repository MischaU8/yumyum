It's good to remember that you can edit geometry that you've constructed on with modeling operations such as [[booleans]], by simply [[offsetting faces]] and using the [[transform tools]] such as move and scale.

This enables you to make significant changes at any time freeing you to explore unlimited options.

Be sure to take advantage of this freedom to experiment in Plasticity.
