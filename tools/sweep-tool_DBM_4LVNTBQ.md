the sweep tool and plasticity to use the
sweep tool you need a curve to sweep
along and a profile to sweep for this

duplicate them to create a curve then
create a curve with six sides using the
regular polygon tool at the start of the
curve with the hexagon curve selected

you're all set use this tool as an
alternative to the pipe tool to sweep
