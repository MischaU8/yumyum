To use the *sweep tool* you need a curve to sweep along and a [[profile]] to sweep.

For this example I'll select these edges and duplicate them (`Shift-D`) to create a curve. Then create a curve with six sides using the [[regular polygon tool]] at the start of the curv.

With the hexagon curve selected, click the sweep icon in the lower right corner of the UI or press `Shift-P` then select the curve to sweep along and you're all set.

Use this tool as an alternative to the [[pipe tool]] to sweep custom profiles along a curve.
