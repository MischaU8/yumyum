When using any of the [[transform tools]], pressing the `F` key will enable you to reposition the tool's pivot.

For the [[move tool]] (`G F`) click anywhere in the 3D space on a point, edge or face to reposition the pivot then move the selection to the desired location.

This can make it extremely easy to snap to elements when using the move tool.

When using freestyle with the scale (`S F`) and rotate (`R F`) tools you can create a reference line that you can transform along.

Add this powerful feature to your toolkit for additional control when moving rotating and scaling in Plasticity.
