You can enable the *silhouette display mode* by right-clicking on the [[render mode]] icon in the top right corner of the viewport and selecting it from the options available.

When enabled, objects will be displayed as a solid shape with no interior details.

This display mode can be extremely useful when designing, since the silhouette is the most immediately recognizable and
identifiable shape of an asset.

Take advantage of this display mode to help aid in the design of your assets.
