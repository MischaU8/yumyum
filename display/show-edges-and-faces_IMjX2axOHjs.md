If you right click on the [[render mode]] icon in the top right portion of the UI, you can toggle edge visibility using the *Show edges* button.

I often disable the *Show edges* attribute to get a better look at the surface on my asset.

You can also disable face visibility with the *Show faces* button.

Use these two options to customize how your assets are displayed in the viewport.
