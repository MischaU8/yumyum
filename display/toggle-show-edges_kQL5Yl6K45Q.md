While you can disable show edges by clicking on the *Show edges* button in the [[render mode]] popover, I find it easier to assign it to a hotkey.

Press `F` on the keyboard, type `toggle` then right click on *Viewport: toggle edges* and select [[Assign shortcut]].

Choose a key that works best for you, I've chosen the tilde (`~`) key which is easy to access.

Use this simple setup to speed up working in Plasticity.
