You can locate the performance graph in the lower right corner of the UI. Clicking the three dot (â€¦) icon will reveal additional graphs.

You can use these graphs to measure frame rendering performance, geometry calculation performance when performing actions such as a [[fillet]] or [[boolean]] and nurbs to polygon faceting performance.

While you can ignore these graphs for the most part they can be useful to see what your hardware performance is while using Plasticity and they can also be useful information when sharing user feedback with the developers.
