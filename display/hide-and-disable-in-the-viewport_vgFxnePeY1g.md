If you'd like to disable the visibility of the current selection you can click the eye icon for the item or use the keyboard shortcut `H`. Click the icon again to unhide.

Using the disable and viewport option appears to do the same thing but has a key difference to the hide feature.

Objects disabled in viewport will remain hidden even when the unhide all keyboard shortcut `alt-H` is used.

Use a combination of these two options to allow for more visual scene control.
