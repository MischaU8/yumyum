When generating new curves, measurements will be displayed which can aid in the accuracy of their creation.

If you have no need for this information or simply want to temporarily disable them, navigate to *Preferences* from the main menu, then go to the *Grid & Units* options and disable the *Show measurements when drawing curves* feature.

With this option inactive measurements will no longer be displayed.

Add this display option to your toolkit to customize your workflow in Plasticity.
